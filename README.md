- 🚀 Just Launched: AI-Powered Research Paper Summarization Tool! 🔍📚
- Built with 💻 Python, Streamlit, and LangChain, this app transforms complex research papers into clear, customized summaries — tailored for different learning styles and depths of understanding.
- This app delivers precise, structured summaries of cutting-edge AI papers like:
📄 Attention Is All You Need
📄 BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers
📄 GPT-3: Language Models are Few-Shot Learners
📄 Diffusion Models Beat GANs on Image Synthesis
✨ This is just the beginning — the free version supports a few papers, but the paid version (coming soon!) will allow uploading any PDF and extracting insights on demand.
