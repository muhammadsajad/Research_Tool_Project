 🚀 Just Launched: AI-Powered Research Paper Summarization Tool! 🔍📚 <br />
Built with 💻 Python, Streamlit, and LangChain, this app transforms complex research papers into clear, customized summaries — tailored for different learning styles and depths of understanding. <br />
This app delivers precise, structured summaries of cutting-edge AI papers like: <br />
📄 Attention Is All You Need <br />
📄 BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers <br />
📄 GPT-3: Language Models are Few-Shot Learners <br />
📄 Diffusion Models Beat GANs on Image Synthesis <br />
✨ This is just the beginning — the free version supports a few papers, but the paid version (coming soon!) will allow uploading any PDF and extracting insights on demand. <br />
